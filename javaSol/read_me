Task: given single-token search string, find count of all instances in text file.

Requirements: Java7

To run: JAR file is in dist folder, testfile paths currently require navigating to dist folder on command line then run “java -jar StringSearch-20190124.jar”

To compile: from javaSol directory, run “ant compile”, to create new JAR run “ant dist”

JAR file currently runs all applicable functional tests on each of 3 solution methods
  Simple string matching
  Regular expression matching
  Preprocessing into hash table then lookup

Files for each test dir:
 testfile.txt - text file to search for occurences of search string.
 search_terms.txt - list of search strings, 1 per line.
 result*.txt - corresponding expected counts, 1 per line, for search strings in search_terms.txt.
